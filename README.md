# UTDesign EPICS [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) Template Project

This project is the template used for all EPICS CS projects. The core technologies used are:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org): A full stack web development framework
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io): A database ORM used to connect Next.js to a database
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org): An open source SQL database

## Getting Started

1. The first thing to do is edit this file. The title and description of the project should reflect your project, the organization it is for, and the target functionality.
2. Setup your development environment to ensure you have everything installed to run the project (see the [prerequisites section](#prerequisites)).
3. Run your project (see the [running the project section].(#running-your-project))
4. Start coding!

## Prerequisites

## Running Your Project

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
